### Makes creating Dialogue System for Your game just a bit easier.

# Installation
To install go to the [**releases page**](https://github.com/AndyFilter/DialogueMaker/releases/latest); You'll find 2 files there, one named **DialogueMaker.exe** and the other one named **DialogueMakerNet.exe**. Try downloading the **first one**, if it **wont work** for some reason then try with the **second one**. If both wont work, then contact me, or just compile the code Yourself. The program runs on **.NET 5**

# How to use
I think I'm gonna do some more explaining in the program itself for now even though it's pretty self explanatory. All You do is **create a project**, go to the *Create Tab* **create some dialogues** and **test them** in the *Test Tab*. When You think You are done save the dialogues, go back to the *Project Tab*, select the desired export path and press ***Export***.

Now that You have a *.Json* file all You need to do is import it into Your game and code Your *Dialogue System* for it. I'll add example for **Godot** and maybe some other game engines.

# To Do

 - [ ] Better user interface (Darkmode etc.)
 - [x] User response dialogue
 - [x] Option to rename the project
 - [ ] Auto-Save function
 - [ ] Add a search function (For NPC and Dialogue)
 - [ ] Add Json object instructions to [README.md](https://github.com/AndyFilter/DialogueMaker/blob/main/README.md)
 - [ ] Add customization and user settings

# Pull requests
Feel free to do pull requests, and edit the code hoverer You like. The software is distributed under a **MIT license**.

# Contact
Preferable method of contact would be my discord: ***IsPossible#8212***. You can **send me anything** you want, from **issues** regarding the software through **new features** to add and even **pictures of Your cat**. If I'll be getting too many messages I'll think about making a Discord Server, but I don't expect this program to get more than 100 downloads.

# Other Information
There is not much to say about that except that if You want **more frequent updates** and fixes, please **consider [Donating](https://www.paypal.me/MaciejGrzeda)**. Also, sorry for the code being a bit messy, I don't think I'll fix that anytime soon ðŸ˜….
